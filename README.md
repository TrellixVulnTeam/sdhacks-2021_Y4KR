# sdhacks-2021

project for the remote education track of SD HACKS 2021, for which we created a web app for summarizing readings and articles. through this, we learned how to use figma for prototyping, natural language processing to summarize articles via the SMMRY API, and use Flask to link our back-end to css/html front-end.
